See following the two recursive functions,

C(0) = 0

C(1) = 5

C(K) = C(K-1) + 4



F(0) = 1

F(1) = 2

F(N) = F(N-1) + C(N-1)

Now you are given N, you have to find the value of F (N).

Input:

Input starts with an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer N

Constraints 

T<=800000

0<=N<=1000000000

Output:

For each test case, print the value of F (N). The value of F (N) fits in 64-bit signed integer.
